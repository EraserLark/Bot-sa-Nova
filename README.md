# Botsa-Nova

This was created for the GMTK Game Jam 2021 using Unity, with a team of four. My personal first game jam, I helped brainstorm game mechanics and worked alongside one other programmer on the coding for this game. I learned a lot about working with a team under a tight deadline with this project. We placed #203 out of 5500+ submissions!
